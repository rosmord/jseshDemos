# jseshBitmapDemo

A simple (and hopefully up-to date) example of how to use JSesh to produce PNG pictures.


(further documentation will come here).

## Layout control

JSesh layout control.... well, let's say it's a system which has evolved "naturally" from
a rough base where fine control on layout didn't seem to matter. In other words, it's awfully 
awkward and convoluted, and it should change at some point and become more precise and straightforward. But for the moment, it's not.
